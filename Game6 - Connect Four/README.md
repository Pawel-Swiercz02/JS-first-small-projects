Checking for wins is kind of lazy:
  - I've created an array with all possible win combinations (since the grid is 7x6 so not too big)
  - Then after every players move, I loop over each possible win combination and check if it appeared on board
Will probably try to figure out a more clever way to do it and change it in the futre.
