CONTROLS:
- Left Arrow to move left
- Right Arrow to move right

Your goal is to destroy all the blue blocks with the red ball.



Works pretty fine, but there are small details that I could fix in the future if I revisit this project:
  - Sometimes the ball goes through a block for a while, before 'destroying' it (thats because the balls anchor point is its bottom left 'corner' - so a block breaks when it's touched by the balls bottom left 'corner') (I know balls don't have corners but you know what I mean)
