CONTROLS:
- Press START/PAUSE button to start or pause the game.
- Up Arrow to move 1 space up
- Down Arrow to move 1 space down
- Left Arrow to move 1 space left
- Right Arrow to move 1 space right

The goal is to move the froggy (green square) from the start line (blue square) to the finish line (red square), while avoiding cars (black squares) and water (light blue squares).

Graphic design is my passion, ik.

NOTES:

The start/pause button works great, but a Reset button would be a good addition, so you can replay the game after winning/losing without having to refresh the page.
